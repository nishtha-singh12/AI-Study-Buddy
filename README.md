# 🎓 AI STUDY BUDDY

- **Live Demo** : https://ai-study-buddy-01.streamlit.app/

AI Study Buddy is a **professional, data-driven academic support system** designed to assist students in improving their academic performance through **predictive analytics and personalized AI guidance**. The system integrates machine learning–based exam score prediction with a large language model (LLM) accessed via the Groq API to deliver study recommendations, lifestyle insights, and motivational support.

## 📌 Project Overview

**AI Study Buddy** is an interactive, data-driven platform that predicts student performance and provides personalized study guidance through its AI chatbot - **AI Study Companion**. It includes a **“Today’s Task”** section where students can write, plan, and track their daily goals.

The platform uses student data—including gender, study hours, attendance, mental health, sleep, diet, part-time work, parental education, extracurricular activity, and social media usage—to generate **predicted exam scores, personalized study plans, daily timetables, motivational guidance** and **lifestyle insights**.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Predict Academic Performance:** Use machine learning models to predict student scores based on study habits, attendance, and lifestyle factors.
- **Analyze Lifestyle Impact:** Evaluate how study hours, sleep hours, diet, mental health, attendance, and social media usage affect academic performance.
- **Provide Personalized Study Plans:** Generate personalized study plan and daily time table according to student's predicted score.
- **Offer Motivational Guidance:** Give tips and encouragement to help students improve their study habits and stay motivated.
- **Enable Daily Task Management:** Allow students to plan, write, and track their daily tasks effectively.
- **AI Student Companion:** A personalized AI chatbot powered by Qwen/Qwen3.6-27B via Groq API, providing academic and lifestyle guidance based on the student’s profile.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Students enter academic and lifestyle details (sidebar).
2. The system processes the data and predicts exam performance using a trained ML model.
3. Motivational feedback and a lifestyle impact summary highlight factors affecting performance.
4. A personalized study plan and daily timetable are generated based on the predicted score.
5. AI Study Companion chatbot (Tab2) provides guidance using the student’s profile and prediction, powered by a large language model (Qwen/Qwen3.6-27B) accessed via the Groq API.
